###IELTS

I wish i could get 7.5 in ielts. Maybe if i try hard there is a possibility but i am afraid, i am narvous. I can talk good english with a little bit absurd pronounciation with all indians do but whenever i do so, i feel like i have to improve a lot which is quiet impossible at this time.[this is a link](https://goatik.github.io/my-writings/)
